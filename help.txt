<h1>What's in here?</h1>

<p>
A web application for learning the relation between a pair of morphological categories, e.g. singular and plural.  You can try some of the existing simulations, or upload your own files.


<!-- 
<h1>Use your console</h1>
Opening the web console/Javascript console is highly recommended, e.g. in order to get  potentially useful information about any errors.
The details vary from browser to browser, so use Google to find specific instructions. For example, if you are using Firefox, Google "firefox how to open the web console".

<h1>Using your own files</h1>

<p>
You can give the learner your own files. The files are kept as a part of your browser; they will not be available on a different computer or even on a different browser on the same computer. They never get sent anywhere outside your computer.


<h2>Training data</h2>

<p>
This is the only required file. It is a text file, with a pair of words in each line, separated by a tab. A third tab can specify the observed frequency of the paradigm. Anything after the third tab is ignored.

<p>
The sounds in each of the two words are separated by spaces.


<h2>Testing data (wugs)</h2>

<p>
This is a text file, with a word in each line. Anything after a tab character is ignored.

<p>
The sounds in each word are separated by spaces.

<p>
If you don't supply testing data, the learner will take in the real words of the language, put them into sublexicons, and fit a grammar to each sublexicon. No wug testing will occur. 

<h2>Constraint set</h2>

<p>
This is a text file, with one constraint in each line. Following a tab, an optional mu can be specified, followed by an optional sigma after the second tab. Anything after the third tab is ignored.
<p>
If you don't supply a constraint set, no forms will violate any constraints. The harmony of each candidate will be zero, and the probability distribution will be uniform and flat.

<p>
Markedness constraints are regular expressions.

Faithfulness (explain here)




<h2>Feature matrix</h2>

<p>
This is a text file, with one sound/phone/segment in each line. If you don't supply it, <a href="lib/default_feature_file.txt" target="_blank" download="default_feature_file.txt">the default feature file</a> will be used instead.  This file is based on Hayes' 2009 textbook, with minor modifications.

<p>
The first row must specify feature names, separated by tabs. The first tab must have the word "symbol".
<p>
The second row must specify the empty symbol, which must be named "empty".



<h2>Configuration file</h2>

<p>
This is a text file in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON format</a>. It is a rather strict format. If you don't supply a configuration file, <a href="lib/default_config_file_template.txt" target="_blank" download="default_config_file.txt">the default configuration file</a> will be used instead. 

<p>
Is a good place to give a name and description for your data, even if all of the parameters have their default values.
